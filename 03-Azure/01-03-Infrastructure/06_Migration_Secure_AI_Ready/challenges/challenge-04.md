# Challenge 4 - Assess VMs for the migration

[Previous Challenge Solution](challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](challenge-05.md)


In most cases, you don't want to migrate all machines at once, but want to prioritize workload by workload and even understand what the dependencies between workloads are. You then look at each phase or wave of migration and break down the risks and workloads.

## Goal 

The goal of this exercise is to ...

* measure the readiness and estimates the effect of migrating on-premises servers to Azure
* review the assessment output to understand the readiness and sizing recommendations
* review the dependencies between the discovered servers

## Actions

* Group machines for the assessment
* Create an Azure VM assessment
* Review assessment output and recommendations
* Enable and review dependency analysis

## Success criteria

* You created a machine group
* You successfully created an Azure VM assessment
* You reviewed the assessment output and recommendations
* You enabled and reviewed the dependencies of the discovered server
