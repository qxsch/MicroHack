## MicroHack introduction

### What is Business Continuity?

When you design for resiliency, you must understand your availability requirements.
- How much downtime is acceptable? 
- How much will potential downtime cost your business?
- How much should you invest in making the application highly available?
- You also must define what it means for the application to be available.

üí° For instance, would you consider the application to be ‚Äòunavailable‚Äô if it allows you to place an order, but fails to process it within the usual time period? Also, it‚Äôs crucial to evaluate the likelihood of a system failure. Is implementing a countermeasure strategy financially justifiable? Remember, effective resilience planning is rooted in the business‚Äôs needs. Here are some strategies to guide your thinking when planning for system resiliency.

The following picture describes in detail the individual levels / disaster recovery tier levels and also provides an overview of which topics we should deal with when talking about disaster recovery. The individual terms, terminologies and categories will be discussed in this microhack which will also provide one approach and a few tips on how to define them in your own company.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of building a Business Continuity Strategy with a focus on best practices and the design principles, as well as some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, it builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.
