# Challenge 1 - Understand the migratable estate 

**[Home](../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](challenge-02.md)

## Goal

Before a migration can start you need to first understand what needs to be migrated and why. The first challenge is therefore about analyzing the current application and hosting environment. You will compare classic deployments (like the Azure App Service) with containerized deployments to understand the differences and advantages of both approaches.

## Actions

Have a look in the Git repository of the application and the App Service resource in Azure to familiarize yourself with the current environment. Then answer these questions:

* In which framework and version is the application written?
* On which operating system (Windows or Linux) is the application currently running?
* What message does the application state when you open in the browser?


**!!!Important: You can ignore the text fields and the button for now, the functionality behind it will be added in the last challenge!!!**

Read through the learning resources and answer the following questions:

* What is containerization and what is a container?
* What are typical advantages of containerization?
* Why would a migration from a PaaS hosting to containerization make sense?
* Which container services are available on Azure?

Bonus question:

When migrating from the App Service to a containerized hosting, which service would be most suitable from you point of view?

## Success criteria

* You answered all questions from above
* You have an overview of containerization and PaaS (and respective Azure services)
* You successfully started the web app in your browser
