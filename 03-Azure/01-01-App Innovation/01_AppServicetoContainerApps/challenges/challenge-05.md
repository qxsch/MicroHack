[Previous Challenge Solution](challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](finish.md)

## Goal

Your production-ready Container App is still missing one thing, you cannot really use it for anything, yet. Time to host your own small AI model that you can chat with via the app.

## Actions

* Host an Ollama container image in a second Container App (or any other model)
* Start an Ollama model in the Container App
* Add the URL of the AI app to your main app via an environment variable

## Success criteria

* You can chat with an AI model via your app

## Learning resources

* [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
* [Ollama on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama)
